# Study of Data Structures and Algorithms

I'm using this repo to study, analyze, familiarize with, and scrutinize DSA 
by using JavaScript.

I'll be using Lecture Notes for Data Structures and Algorithms (a revised version 
of 27th March, 2019 by John Bullinaria of the School of Computer Science, University of 
Birmingham, Birmingham, UK) as a guide, but most of my learning will come from the wild 
of the web.

## Objectives
1. Cement my understanding of JavaScript
2. Understand common DSAs and their nuances
3. Implement common DSAs using JavaScript

## Goals
1. To be able to identify a DSA with a problem specification
2. To port my understanding of DSAs to other programming tools
