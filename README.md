# Study of Data Structures and Algorithms

I'm using this repo to study, analyze, familiarize with, and scrutinize common DSAs 
by using JavaScript.

I'll be using [Lecture Notes for Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjCyf2v5bL4AhXRuKQKHasMAd8QFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.bham.ac.uk%2F~jxb%2FDSA%2Fdsa.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1_rAAPVg4Mt-TNx9qhoSSS)
by John Bullinaria - School of Computer Science, University of 
Birmingham, Birmingham, UK - as a guide, but most of my learning will come from the wild 
of the web.

## Objectives
1. To be able to identify a DSA with a problem specification
2. To port my understanding of DSAs to other programming tools
3. To develop intuition on performance cost of an algorithm
4. To have fun

## Goals
1. Cement my understanding of JavaScript
2. Understand common DSAs and their nuances
3. Implement common DSAs using JavaScript

## Chatter
JavaScript is such an expressive language if one truly knows what they are doing. I've been 
using JavaScript (wrongly) for some time, but not until I read Marijn Haverbeke's [Eloquent JavaScript](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj6tNLw4LT4AhURiv0HHYqcBzMQFnoECC4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.umn.edu%2Fopentextbooks%2Ftextbooks%2F453&usg=AOvVaw1Za73ZFX8KdBtaSnZE8bRN) 
did it all fit together nicely (or so I thought).

Then I picked up [JavaScript: The Good Parts](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiC5Jqd4bT4AhXPiv0HHXLqDjAQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford%2Fdp%2F0596517742&usg=AOvVaw0bNaJO-1rUDsDyO9_dK2Z2) by Douglas Crockford himself (JSON is Doug's SON!). 
The book literally changed my understanding of JavaScript and the cosmos!
Doug has done nothing less than speaking into my soul; of the beauty, power and expressiveness 
that is JavaScript.

In his [autobiography](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwipjvyz4bT4AhUOi_0HHWSND6IQFnoECAoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJust-Fun-Story-Accidental-Revolutionary%2Fdp%2F0066620732&usg=AOvVaw04A37d2YTfQgFL_DV0BG9I), Linus Torvalds (hallowed be his name) speaks of 
Tanenbaum's [Operating Systems... oh never mind: The Minix Book](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjXr7PA4bT4AhX5lP0HHYKhDMAQFnoECAsQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FOperating-Systems-Design-Implementation-3rd%2Fdp%2F0131429388&usg=AOvVaw1QOYJxAO5KE97GCN8JuE9g) as the book that changed his life. 
I have read books before, but I've never thought a book to be life changing until, 
well you guessed it, until I read Douglas (oh, and his [blog](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiHgKH84bT4AhWs_rsIHWSCAh4QFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crockford.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw05YjezyHx7aiLm_SRDFtvb)).

Though I owe my rather limited (but ever growing) understanding of the machine and the world to 
many great men and women (or should I say `/[^]*/g`), I dare say Doug helped me find JesuScript. 
I do not intend to be bent to the will of the machine ever again, for I'm saved.
