# Study of Data Structures and Algorithms

I'm using this repo to study, analyze, familiarize with, and scrutinize DSA 
by using JavaScript.

I'll be using [Lecture Notes for Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjCyf2v5bL4AhXRuKQKHasMAd8QFnoECBkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.bham.ac.uk%2F~jxb%2FDSA%2Fdsa.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1_rAAPVg4Mt-TNx9qhoSSS)
by John Bullinaria - School of Computer Science, University of 
Birmingham, Birmingham, UK - as a guide, but most of my learning will come from the wild 
of the web.

## Objectives
1. To be able to identify a DSA with a problem specification
2. To port my understanding of DSAs to other programming tools
3. To develop intuition on performance cost of an algorithm
4. To have fun

## Goals
1. Cement my understanding of JavaScript
2. Understand common DSAs and their nuances
3. Implement common DSAs using JavaScript
